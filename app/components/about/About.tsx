      <p>
        Hello, Iâ€™m a front-end developer with 6+ years of experience building
        accessible, user-focused web apps using React and TypeScript. I enjoy
        working closely with designers and product teams to create interfaces
        that are thoughtful, consistent, and aligned with business goals.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also care about writing clean, maintainable code and creating
        solutions that are easy to understand and build on not just for users,
        but for the developers who maintain them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Always happy to chat about all things front end, clean UX, or just how
        to make things better.
      </p>
    </p>
  </Article>
