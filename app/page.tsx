        <h1>ðŸ‘‹ Hey, Iâ€™m Wiola, a Front-End Developer</h1>
        <p>
          Iâ€™ve been building web apps with React, TypeScript, and design systems for
          over 6 years - always with a focus on accessibility, clean UX, and code thatâ€™s easy to work with.
        </p>
        <p>
          I love working with designers and product teams to bring ideas to life,
          and I care a lot about making things that are not just usable - but enjoyable.
        </p>
